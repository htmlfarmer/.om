version one... called? 
vamonos?

.om 
VAMONOS (version 1.0]
https://github.com/htmlfarmer/.om

what would it be like if ALL software in the future is "spiritual?'

for privacy reasons the "first version isn't normal working version' its a "broken security version' that emphasizes SPIRITUAL OFFLINE SUBMISSION.  its also "not suppose to work' using your own local cultural references.  

so what does the software do?  hopefully helps with 100% OFFLINE!  i also made effort to remove ALL NORMAL LOGICAL CODE that is "not kid child hilarious and end adult safe'

its important to review some history of "spiritual internet' if your familiar with a company EXCITE it went out of business? or SOMAFM.com when SOMA FM came out it was a very big success quietly in San Francisco California?  however a "drug' search engine failed? called EXCITE?  perhaps the "modern legalization' of online drugs is instagram?  meaning in english insta gram measurement of a drug max value?

you might recall SOMA as a prominent fictional drug in Aldous Huxley's classic book "Brave New World' (1932). written just before world war II?  

our goal ... with .om is to help understand how AI is useful is understanding "spirituality' and help understand a impossible brave new spiritual world "offline?'

hope this helps other software developers rethink about OFFLINE SPIRITUAL SUBMISSION.

overall i would say i'm not happy with this.
and i expect some radical spiritual changes to software development in the near future.

thanks.
